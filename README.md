## Introduction

I created this as a template and review for the Systems Division at the [UE Research and Development Unit](http://www.uernd.org/).

## Installation

Should install by itself.

## Stuff I Used

* [CodeIgniter-Bootstrap] (https://github.com/sjlu/CodeIgniter-Bootstrap) as the PHP framework. Although the other frameworks have more features, I think CI is good for a starting framework.
* [Lo-Dash 1.3.1] (http://lodash.com/) for some JavaScript utility functions.
